## Analysis

I will be working on ... 

1. Improving speed limit information. To do this, we will replace the network_setting function using the osmnx.speed module. The replacement of the network_setting function with the osmnx.speed module may help refine the accuracy of the speed limit information in the transportation network model. This modification may allow for a more realistic representation of road speeds, impacting the overall accuracy of accessibility results.

2. Improving translation from hospital catchments into hexagons. The implementation of Area Weighted Aggregation (AWR) in place of the 50% threshold from the original study will be a significant enhancement for translating hospital catchments into hexagons. This change will offer a more refined representation in the hexagonal grid, addressing uncertainties and improving internal validity.

## Results

1. Using the osmnx.speed module will most likely change the speed limit data checks before & after network_setting. The improved speed limit dataset, with more accurate values based on road types, may contribute to enhanced content validity, fixing the initial overgeneralization issue. 

2. To do this, we will focus on the overlap_calc function. The shift from a binary assessment of overlap to a more nuanced, weighted approach with AWR may lead to an increase in accessibility across various zones. It may also allow for a more accurate depiction of accessibility patterns, especially when considering different settings such as buffered areas, populations over 50, and ICU beds.

## Discussion

1. This improvement is essential for addressing the overgeneralization issue and enhancing the accuracy of accessibility metrics. It will ensuresthat the study's findings are not skewed by inaccuracies in speed limit data, contributing to the overall validity of the research. The impact of speed limits on different population groups will emphasize the importance of this modification in ensuring a better understanding of healthcare resource accessibility.

2. The introduction of AWR may contribute to the study's internal validity and provide a more accurate representation of healthcare resource accessibility. This modification may help in overcoming uncertainties and improving the accuracy of accessibility maps.
